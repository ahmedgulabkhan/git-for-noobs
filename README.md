## What is Git?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to 
software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to 
source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help 
software teams work faster and smarter.

Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. Having a distributed 
architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System). Rather than have 
only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular 
version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's 
working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

## Setting it up locally
### Installation

To install Git on your local machine, visit [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
Depending on your operating system, download and install the latest version accordingly. During the 
installation process, make sure that you select thr option to add **git** to your path. This makes 
sure that the git commands are recognized from any location in the terminal.

### Verify the installation
Open your terminal and type the command `git --version`, if you see the git version in the output, it 
means that the installation was successful.

### Some useful options
`git --version` prints the Git version that is currently installed.

`git --help` prints the synopsis, and a list of the most commonly used commands. 

`git --help -all` If the option --all or -a is given then all the available commands are printed. 

`git --help config` If a Git command is mentioned, this option will bring up the manual page for 
that command in your browser.
